LSH Clone
===
This is a clone of the lsh, a simplistic shell program created by [Stephen Brennen](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/). I remade this program to practice my C skills. Currently, the builtins present in it are similars to the one created by the original authors, i.e. 
 - ls
 - cd
 - exit
 - help
However, I intent to add more in future.
